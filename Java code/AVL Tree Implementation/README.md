Implementation of AVL tree (A self balancing binary tree where the difference of the heights of two children of a node is not greater than 1 ).
if the binary tree has an imbalance (the difference of the heights of two children of a node is not greater than 1),
roataions are performed to ensure the tree stays balanced, and hence always has a time comlexity of O(logn).
